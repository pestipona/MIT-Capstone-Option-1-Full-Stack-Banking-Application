# 25.2.4. Automatic Documentation:

Here **you’ll configure** `swagger-jsdoc` and `swagger-ui-express`. You’ll **work through** a **library application** example and **automatically generate** an **API** for a **GET route**, with accompanying **documentation** using **these tools**.

Follow the steps in [25.2.3. Install Packages](/Docs/25.2.3.%20Install%20Packages.md) to **recreate the environment**, and **install** all **packages** and **dependencies** for **the project**.

To **start the application** run `npm start`

```shell
npm start
```

Next, **let's configure** `swaggerDoc`, and `swaggerUI`, and we will **start off** by entering here **options** for **Swagger**. Now, if you want to **look more** at **the details** of **why I have chosen** what **I have chosen**. You can **take a look there** at the **npm packages documentation**.

* But at a **high level** you can see there that **I am setting** a `title:`, a `'Library API'`, a `version:`.
* I'm also **pointing to the path** of **the API**, which in this case is **simply this file** `['app.js']`.
* And that I am then **passing those options** into `swaggerDocs`, as you can see there.
* Next, **we will pass** the **configuration** into `express`. And **you can see there** that we're using `app.use`. And you can see there **the path** that **we're defining**. In this case, it's `'/api-docs'`. **We can call it** anything we like. And you can see there the **rest of the options** that we are **setting**.

Now, once again, **if you want to know more** about **these packages**, take a look at the **documentation** on **npm**.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const swaggerJsDoc = require('swagger-jsdoc');
const swaggerUI = require('swagger-ui-express');

const swaggerOptions = {
    swaggerDefinition : {
        info: {
            title: 'Library API',
            version: '1.0.0'
        }
    },
    apis: ['app.js']
};

const swaggerDocs = swaggerJsDoc(swaggerOptions);
app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUI.serve, swaggerUI.setup(swaggerDocs));

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Running on port 3000');
});
```

So, **let's go ahead** and **test that route** `/api-docs`. Here in **the browser**, we're entering `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`, and as **you can see there**, we get back an empty **swagger documentation**.

![](../Screen_Shots/25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation/Automatic_Documentation_01.png)

Now, **at this point**, let's go ahead and write an **actual route**. And as mentioned, we were going to **create an example** about **books**. And as **you can see here**, I have just **added a route**, a `get` route, under `express` called, the **path is called** `'/books'`. And then we're simply **going to return** there the **following object** for a `Harry Potter` book.

```js
app.get('/books', (req, res) => {
    res.send([
        {
            isbn: '9781781100486',
            title: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone',
            author: 'J.K. Rowling',
            publisher: 'Scholastic'
        }]);
});
```

So, **let's go ahead** and **test that route** `/books`. Here in **the browser**, we're entering `http://localhost:3000/books`, and as **you can see there**, we get back an **array object**.

![](../Screen_Shots/25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation/Automatic_Documentation_02.png)

Now, next **comes the documentation**, and this is **going to be written** in the **comment here** for **that route**. And what we're doing essentially is that **we are using** `YAML`, put `YAML` **in the comments**. *And you might be wondering*, just as I mentioned for the **documentation** of **those packages** where this **YAML comes from**, that is the `YAML` **that is defined** within the **API specification** for `Swagger` that **open specification**.

And if you want to **look at an example** of that, you can **navigate** to the **Swagger site** and **follow the link** for **the editor** or the **live sample of the editor**. And you can see here **how they are documenting** a **set of APIs**. And **you can see here** on the **left-hand side** as well, the **documentation** that **has been created** for this `get` path. And you can see here the **type of fields** that **you can have**, and the **type of comments** or the **type of data** that **you can configure** on this **with this notation** for this **YAML file**.

![](../Screen_Shots/25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation/Automatic_Documentation_03.png)

So, **let's go ahead** and **do that**. And in my case, I'm going to go ahead and add here **something quite simple**. You can see here **I am starting it out** with a **specific pattern**.

* Therefore, the **comments** that I'm making, I'm setting `swagger`
* Then **the path** that we are **identifying** 
* Then the `get:` **method** in this case, **identifying it** as a `GET` as opposed to a `POST`.
* The **description** that I'm giving
* The **responses** that might come, and you can see there **the details** about this **API** match **that method** that we have before or **below it**.

```js
/**
 * @swagger
 * /books:
 *  get:
 *      description: Get all books
 *      responses:
 *          200:
 *              description: Success
 *
 */
app.get('/books', (req, res) => {
    res.send([
        {
            isbn: '9781781100486',
            title: 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer\'s Stone',
            author: 'J.K. Rowling',
            publisher: 'Scholastic'
        }]);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Running on port 3000');
});
```

So, now **let's go ahead** and **save that file** and **go to the path** that we have **defined**, which is `'http://localhost:3000/api-docs'`. Let's go ahead and **enter that here**, `'/api-docs'`, and as **you can see there** we have an *API** that has been **automatically created** for us.

![Automatic_Documentation_04.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation%2FAutomatic_Documentation_04.png)

And **we can go ahead** and **expand** the **automatically generated documentation**. You can see there that it's, it's using `GET` as **a label** to denote that this is a **GET path**. There's a **lot more information** there, we have, in this case, `no parameters`. But you can see there the **type of response** that **would be coming back**.

![Automatic_Documentation_05.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation%2FAutomatic_Documentation_05.png)

And we can, in fact, **invoke it**. *All of that plumbing*, *all of that* **automatically generated code** has been **created for us**. So, in this case, this is a **very simple API**. We have **no parameters**, however, we can **still go ahead** and **execute it**.

![Automatic_Documentation_06.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation%2FAutomatic_Documentation_06.png)

And if **we scroll down**, you can see there that **the object** that **we returned** is **coming back**. You can see there also that it has **automatically generated** how to **invoke this path** using a `curl` command and also **how to call it** if we were to use just the `URL`.

![Automatic_Documentation_07.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation%2FAutomatic_Documentation_07.png)

So, if I were to **paste this** into a **new tab** here, we can go ahead and **see the same** as **expected**, that **object coming back**.

![Automatic_Documentation_08.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.4_Automatic_Documentation%2FAutomatic_Documentation_08.png)

So, as you can see here, there is **some additional configuration** and there's always the **additional task** of adding the funny `YAML`.

```yaml
/**
 * @swagger
 * /books:
 *  get:
 *      description: Get all books
 *      responses:
 *          200:
 *              description: Success
 *
 */
```

But **once you get used** to it, this is **minimal effort** to be able to **document your API** and be able to **share that more readily**. So, this is a **good practice** that **many groups follow** and one that would be **good for you to know**. So, go ahead and add, **walk through** the **additional configuration**, take a look at **how this could be documented** and **make an example** for yourself.

Don't forget to **close the server** by entering `CTRL + C`. This will also free up `port 3000`.

```shell
CTRL + C
```
