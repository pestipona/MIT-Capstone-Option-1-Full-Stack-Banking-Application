**APIs** specify how you **need to structure** your **requests** in order to **communicate** with a **server**. This week, youâ€™ll **define** and **document APIs** with a tool called [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), which will help you **automatically align** to the **open-source REST standard** for **APIs**.

So, let's talk about **APIs**, **application program interfaces**. They're one of the most important **architectural patterns** that we use to **break apart** our **software**. So, we'll see **API is used**, for example, on a **web server**. And **they'll specify** how you **need to structure** your **messages** to **communicate** with that **web server**. There's an **open-source standard**, and we're going to **use a tool** called [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) that **follows that standard** to **define** and **document** our **APIs**.

This means that **if I go to**, for example, to a **website** that has an **API**, I can **download** this **document**, and it will tell me exactly **how to structure** my **HTTP messages** so that **I can hit** that **API**. We're going to use `JSON` to **document** our **Swagger APIs**. They can also use `YAML`. They'll accept `YAML`. I prefer `JSON` because I find it **easier to debug**. I'm familiar with `JavaScript`, and `JSON` is **exactly the same** as we use in `JavaScript`. So, we're **going to use** `JSON` to create a **CRUD interface**. I'll do some of that, and then I'll let you **do the others**.
