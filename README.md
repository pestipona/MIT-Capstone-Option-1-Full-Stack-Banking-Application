## Description:

???

## Installation Guidelines:

This application is fully built, but To replicate this environment on your own follow the build steps outlined below.

### Mongo Database:

To build the mongo database first deploy a Linux EC2 instance in AWS. Once this is deployed follow the next steps to setup the **EC2 instance** & **MongoDB**.

* Install **Node.js** and **npm**, and verify that **npm** is installed
* Install **Docker engine** in EC2 instance
* Start the **Docker service** and **enable** it to start on boot
* **Create** a **mongo database** inside a **docker container** called `afcu-bank`
* Install **mongodb** should be `version 3.6.2` for this exercise to work


## Technology Used:

### Mongo Database:

For the **data store** I used an image of **Mongo DB** that I deployed in a **Docker Container** hosted in an **AWS EC2 Instance**. I could have made this **more efficient** by just deploying the **container** itself without the **EC2 instance**, but since I did not have enough time to configure this. I went first with what I knew which was to deploy the **mongo database container** in an **AWS EC2 instance**. This guide proved helpful [How to connect to Mongodb on AWS EC2 instance with Robomongo?](https://setu677.medium.com/how-to-connect-to-mongodb-on-aws-ec2-instance-with-robomongo-b2977b8a112f).

## Features:

### Using Studio 3T to Monitor MongoDB Container:

The **mongo database** can be monitored **using a connection** via **port 27017** in **Studio 3T** to monitor the **database contents**.

## Future Improvements:

For the database I plan to deploy it straight in AWS ECS (Elastic Container Services) as a container. Since currently the mongo db container I have is hosted within an AWS EC2 Instance, and I would like to eliminate the extra stack there with the EC2 instance.
