### How to serve a Node.js application hosted in an AWS EC2 Instance  through a web server like Nginx?

Serving a Node.js application through a web server like Nginx can provide various benefits like better performance, security, and the ability to run multiple applications on the same server.

Here's a step-by-step guide to serve a Node.js application on an AWS EC2 instance using Nginx:

1. **Install Node.js**: If you haven't installed Node.js on your EC2 instance, you'll need to do that first. You can use package managers like `apt` for Ubuntu or `yum` for Amazon Linux to install Node.js.

2. **Install Nginx**:

   On **Ubuntu**:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nginx
   ```

   On **Amazon Linux**:
   ```bash
   sudo yum install nginx
   ```

   Start Nginx:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start nginx
   ```

   Enable Nginx to start on boot:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable nginx
   ```

3. **Configure Nginx for Your Node.js Application**:

   Create or modify an Nginx server block configuration. A common practice is to create a new configuration file for each site in `/etc/nginx/sites-available/` and then create a symbolic link to it in `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled/`.

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-node-app
   ```

   Add the following configuration:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;

       server_name mydomain.com www.mydomain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; # Assuming your app runs on port 3000
           proxy_http_version 1.1;
           proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
           proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
       }
   }
   ```

   Save and close the file. Create a symbolic link to the `sites-enabled` directory:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/my-node-app /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   ```

4. **Test Nginx Configuration**:

   Before applying the changes, you should check the configuration for syntax errors:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

   If everything is okay, you should see a message indicating that the configuration test is successful.

5. **Restart Nginx**:

   Apply the configuration changes by restarting Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

6. **Update Security Groups**:

   Ensure that your EC2 instance's security group allows incoming traffic on port `80` (for HTTP) and `443` (for HTTPS, if you're planning on setting up SSL).

7. **Start Your Node.js Application**:

   Run your Node.js application, ensuring it's listening on the port specified in the Nginx configuration (in this example, port 3000).

8. **(Optional) Set Up SSL**:

   If you want to serve your application over HTTPS, you can use Certbot to obtain a free SSL certificate from Let's Encrypt. Certbot has plugins that work with Nginx, making it easy to obtain and install certificates.

By now, you should be able to access your Node.js application through your domain without specifying the port, and Nginx will proxy the requests to your Node.js application.
