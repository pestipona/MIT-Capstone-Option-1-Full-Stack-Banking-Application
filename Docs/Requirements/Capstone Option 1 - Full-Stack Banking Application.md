![MIT Emeritus.jpg](..%2FPics%2FMIT%20Emeritus.jpg)

## Choosing A Capstone Project:

You can **choose** between **two options** for your **capstone project**:

* **Full-stack banking application**, which you were **introduced** to in **Week 27**. This **project** is **recommended** if you have found the **course challenging** or just at the **right level**.
* **Full-stack restaurant application**, which you will **learn about** in **Weeks 28** and **29**. This **project** is **recommended** if you want an **additional challenge**, as it will **involve new tools** and **frameworks**.
* Both **capstone options** require you to **submit a link** to your **working application** and **three**, **5-minute video presentations** discussing your project.

## Full-Stack Banking Application Project Introduction:

For the **full-stack banking application capstone project**, you will **submit four deliverables**:

* **Three presentation videos** discussing **different aspects** of your **project**
* A **link** to your **full-stack banking application website**
