# 25.2.3. Install Packages:

Start by **installing** these **npm packages**:

* [swagger-jsdoc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-jsdoc)
* [swagger-ui-express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express)
* [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
* [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon)

Then **create your own** `“Hello World!”` **application** to **test** that your **code is executing**.

We will **start by installing** the following **four npm packages**. The **first one** is an **integration** with `swagger-jsdoc`. The **second one** is the same which is an **integration** with `express`, then `express`, then `nodemon` to give us **auto-reloading**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_011.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_011.jpg)

Now, in the **editor**, as you can see here, I have an **open directory** called `books`, and with **no files** inside of it. I am at the **same location** in the **terminal**.

```shell
cd "D:\My Documents\MIT Full Stack Development\Module 25 - API Documentation and Intro To Database\Module 25.0 - API Doc and Intro To Database\Self-Study_Activities\25.2.3. Install Packages"

mkdir books
cd ./books
```

Now, at this point, **let's go ahead** and **create** an `npm` application. And as you can see here, we will go with the **default**, default `version:`, `description:`, we will say `auto doc`. The **entry point** will be `app.js`. That's **the name** that I will give to our **first file** that will **hold our code**. No `task command:`, no `git repository:`, no `keywords:`. My `paul_estipona@mit.edu` as the `author:`, `license:` of `MIT`, I will enter `yes`.

```shell
npm init
```

![Install_Packages_01.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FInstall_Packages_01.png)

And now, **we can see** our **documentation** as you can **see here** in `package.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "books",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "auto doc",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "paul_estipona@mit.edu",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

Next, **let's go ahead** and **install the packages**. And as you can see here, we have the **four packages** that **we mentioned**.

* swagger-jsdoc
* express
* swagger-ui-express
* nodemon

I'm going to go ahead and **install these**.

```shell
npm install swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express express nodemon
```

And as you can see there, that has been **carried out**.

![Install_Packages_02.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FInstall_Packages_02.png)

And now, **we can see** our **documentation** as you can **see here** an **update** in our `package.json` with the installed `dependencies`.

```json
{
  "name": "books",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "auto doc",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "author": "paul_estipona@mit.edu",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1",
    "swagger-jsdoc": "^6.2.8",
    "swagger-ui-express": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

Next, let's **add a script** to our `package.json` file to be *able to leverage* **auto-reloading**. And as you can see there, I will use **the keyword** `"start"`. So, npm `"start"`, and then `"nodemon app.js"`. So now, **let's go ahead** and **save**.

```json
{
  "name": "books",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "auto doc",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "author": "paul_estipona@mit.edu",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1",
    "swagger-jsdoc": "^6.2.8",
    "swagger-ui-express": "^5.0.0"
  }
}
```

**Go back** to our **terminal**. Let's go ahead and **list our files**. And now, let's go ahead and **create** that `app.js` file. And as you can see there we have now the **bare bones**.

![Install_Packages_03.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FInstall_Packages_03.png)

Now, **let's go ahead** and **add some code** to our `app.js` file.

* And as you can see there, I have added `require` to **those packages** that we **installed**.
* I have also **created an instance**, out of `'('express');'`.
* And now, **let's go ahead and create** a **simple route** at **the root** `'/'` just to **make sure** that **everything** is **working as expected**.
* And so we're going to **go ahead and enter** the **usual naming** here, which is `(req, res)`.
* And then I'm going to go ahead and **use** the **ES6 notation** as you can see there. And I'm simply going to enter `res.send`. And I'm **going to say** `'('Hello World!');'`.
* Now, **let's go ahead** and **save that**.
* Next, we **start the listener** and **express** and enter `app.listen`. And **enter the port number** we're going to be **listening on** which is `port 3000`. 
* Then I'm **going to specify** a **callback** simply to **write a message** to **the console**. *It's always a good idea* to **confirm what you're doing**. Give the user some **visual feedback**.
* And so, in this case, I'm simply going to say `'(Running on port 3000');'`.

Go ahead and **save**.

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const swaggerJsDoc = require('swagger-jsdoc');
const swaggerUI = require('swagger-ui-express');

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Running on port 3000');
});
```

Now, **let's go ahead** and **run** `app.js`. So, I'm going to **go ahead** and **enter** `npm start` to **execute that script**.

```shell
npm start
```

And as you can **see there**, **this is now running**, and we have **the message** on **our console** here `'(Running on port 3000');'`, in **the terminal**. And it will also **incorporate any changes** that **we make**.

![Install_Packages_04.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FInstall_Packages_04.png)

So, **let's go ahead** and **test that route** `'/'`. Here in **the browser**, we're **entering** `http://localhost:3000/`, and as **you can see there**, we **get back** as expected  `Hello World!`.

![Install_Packages_05.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.3_Install_Packages%2FInstall_Packages_05.png)

Don't forget to **close the server** by entering `CTRL + C`. This will also free up `port 3000`.

```shell
CTRL + C
```

So, to **overview**, we **installed the packages** that **you see here** and **the dependencies**. Then we went ahead and added **one more script** and that was simply to give us **auto-reloading**. Then we created `app.js`. We **required those packages**, and **we wrote** a **default route** simply **to test** that **our code** is in fact **executing**.

So, now it's your turn. Go ahead and **write those dependencies**, write those **files**, and **make sure** that you can **replicate the code** and the **functionality** that we have done here.
