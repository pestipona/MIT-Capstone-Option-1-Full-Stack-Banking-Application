# 25.2.5. API Documentation Best Practices:

## What is API Documentation?

API documentation **contains clear** and **concise instructions** on **how to use** and **integrate** an **API**.

## API Documentation Best Practices:

### 1. Write Documentation for Nontechnical People

**All users** will have **different levels** of **experience** and **knowledge**, so it is important that you **write documentation** in **simple**, **clear language**.

Review the **documentation** for [Twilio’s APIs](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api), for **instance**. The **writers describe** and **define** what an **API** is and **how it works** at the **very beginning** of **the guide**. They **don’t assume** that **everyone reading** this documentation is an **expert**.

### 2. Include Explicit Request and Response Cycles

Those **using your API** need to know what your **endpoint expects** within the **request body** and **what it could return** as a **response**. For example, if your **endpoint runs** into an **error**, what **response status** and **message** will be **returned**? Detailing that in the **documentation** will **help users** understand **what to expect** and **what’s needed**.

### 3. Keep It as Simple as Possible

A user **trying to read** through **three paragraphs** of text on **one single endpoint** will **feel frustrated**. Where possible, *keep your documentation* **simple and short**, *without* **sacrificing readability**.

### 4. Keep It Up-to-Date

It is **important** to **maintain your documentation**. *Out-of-date* **API documentation** can **lead a developer** in the **wrong direction** and **waste their time**.
