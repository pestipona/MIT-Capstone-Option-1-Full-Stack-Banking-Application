# Capstone Option 1: Full-Stack Banking Application

So, now that **we have** the **files**, let's go ahead and **run** a **small HTTP server** to look at our **application**. As you can see here, I have that **page opened up** at **npm**, the **npm registry** at https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server, and the **command to install** is right there before you `npm i http-server`.

```shell
cd <Project Path>
npm i http - server
http-server
```
When done close server.

```shell
CTRL + C
```
