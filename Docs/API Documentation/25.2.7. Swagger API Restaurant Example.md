# 25.2.7. Swagger API Restaurant Example:

Here you’ll use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) with a **restaurant application**. In this video, **Dr. Williams** will show you **how to create** a `POST` route which **will allow you** to **add restaurants** to **the database**. After **watching the video**, you should **build on this exercise** and **build the route** for **deleting restaurants**. You can review [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/basic-routing.html) on **creating routes**, including the **DELETE route**.

Please ensure that `nodemon` is **installed** *before you watch this video*.  `Nodemon` **automatically re-runs** the **application** whenever you’ve **made an edit** to **the code**. To use `nodemon` you will **need to install** it **globally** by running the **following command** in your **terminal**:

```shell
npm install -g nodemon
```

So, **in this exercise**, we're going to use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) to **document** an **Express web server’s APIs**. So, here I've just **shown one interface**, a `GET`, and we're going to **get restaurants**. And this will **get a list** of **all the restaurants**. But we want to do also `POST` so we can **create a new restaurant** and be able to **do all the other**, **CRUD**, `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_062.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_062.jpg)

But **let's start first** with `Express`. Let's **take a look** at **what we need** in our `package.json` file. So, what we **need to load** in **the code** is `"swagger-ui-express"`. So, `swagger` will **allow us** to **create this documentation** for the **API**.

```json
{
  "name": "restaurants",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "restaurant application",
  "main": "app.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "nodemon app.js"
  },
  "author": "paul_estipona@mit.edu",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1",
    "swagger-jsdoc": "^6.2.8",
    "swagger-ui-express": "^5.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "prettier": "2.1.2"
  }
}
```

So, **let's go ahead** and navigate to our **directory** under `restaurants`, and **install** all the `dependencies` **specified** in our `package.json` file. By running the command `npm install`.

```shell
cd ./restaurants
npm install
```

Okay, so **we've got that loaded**. And let's **take a look** at **our code now** in `index.js`. So, **here's our code**. And we **just loaded** `swagger`.

* Now, here we've got `swaggerUi`, **which we require** `'swagger-ui-express'`.
* And now, I'm going to **put all my description** for **the API** in `'/swagger.json'`, in **a file** called `'swagger.json'`. So, **we'll call** that `swaggerDocument`.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

Okay, so now **let's define restaurants**. I'm **going to pretend** that **we're interfacing** with a **list of restaurants**. So, we're **going to do CRUD** on this **list of restaurants**. Usually, **this would be** in a **database**, but **for now**, we'll just do it **hardcoded on the file** `index.js`.

So, we've got a **list of the restaurants**. There's **two of them**, `id:0` and `id:1`, `"Woodshill"`, and `"Fiorellas"`. So, now we want to **make sure** that we **can get hold of** our `express( );`, and we're **going to use** `(express.json( ));`.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

var restaurants = [
    {id:0, name:"Woodshill"},
    {id:1, name:"Fiorellas"}
]

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

Now, **we want to specify** that we're **going to use** `swaggerDocument`. So, here's `swaggerDocument`. And for the `swaggerUi`, that's what we're **going to use**. So, we're going to **create here** in the **project folder** a file called `swagger.json`, and **we'll fill in** this **document** later.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

var restaurants = [{id:0,name:"Woodshill"}, {id:1,name:"Fiorellas"}]

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument))

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

But **let's get ourselves first** the **list of all restaurants**. So, here is **the route** ` "/restaurants"`. And it's **going to send back** this **list** of `restaurants`. And we're **listening on port 4000**. So, **let's save that**.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

var restaurants = [
    {id:0, name:"Woodshill"},
    {id:1, name:"Fiorellas"}
]

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument))

app.get("/restaurants", (req,res)=>{
    res.send(restaurants);
})

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

And now **let's go** to `swagger.json` now. This **will be used** and **imported** to create the `swaggerDocument`. So, here we are in `swagger.json`. Now, there's just some **basic boilerplate** that you **need to present**.

* The **first** is, we're going to use `"swagger": "2.0",`.
* Then there's **some information** that will **get printed out**.
* ` "My Restaurant Project CRUD" `, this is just a **description** of my **APIs**. 
* They're going to be **running under** `"MIT"` license.
* And the `"host":` is going to be `"localhost:4000"`.
* And the `"basePath":` is **just root** `"/"`.
* And then `"tags":`, ` "name": "Restaurants",` API.
* It's an `HTTP schema`, **consumes** `application/json`, and **produces** `JSON`.

```json
{
  "swagger": "2.0",
  "info": {
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "title": "My Restaurant Project CRUD",
    "description": "My User Project Application API",
    "license": {
      "name": "MIT",
      "url": "https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT"
    }
  },
  "host": "localhost:4000",
  "basePath": "/",
  "tags": [
    {
      "name": "Restaurants",
      "description": "API for users in the system"
    }
  ],
  "schemes": [
    "http"
  ],
  "consumes": [
    "application/json"
  ],
  "produces": [
    "application/json"
  ]
}
```

Now, we **start describing** our `"paths":`

* So, the **first one** is `"get":` and it's on `"/restaurants":`. And we're going to `get` that. And the `"Restaurants"`, we're going to **put this under** the ` "tags":`. So, `tag` is **just breaking up** the `swaggerDocument`. So, we're going to **put everything under** `"Restaurants"`. This is a `"summary":`. `"Get all Restaurants`. And now, **our response** is **going to be** `200`. And then we **need to define** a `"schema":`. So, under `"#/definitions`, so this is **going to be local** to **this file**. And the `"#/definitions` we're **going to have** `/Restaurant"`.


* So, **let's scroll down**. So, here's **our definition** of a `"Restaurant"`. This is the **schema of a restaurant**. We **require** an `"id"` and a `"name"`. The `"properties":` of the ` "id":` that it's an `"integer"` and **it needs to be unique**. And the ` "name":` is of type `"string"`.
  
So, **that's it**. So, **that gives us** the **first route**, which is, **get all the restaurants**.

```json
{
    "paths": {
        "/restaurants": {
            "get": {
                "tags": ["Restaurants"],
                "summary": "Get all Restaurants in system",
                "responses": {
                    "200": {
                        "description": "OK",
                        "schema": {
                            "$ref": "#/definitions/Restaurant"
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        },
      
    "definitions": {
        "Restaurant": {
            "required": ["id","name"],
            "properties": {
                "id": {
                    "type": "integer",
                    "uniqueItems": true
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

So, **let's save that**, and **let's go back** in the **terminal**, and we'll do `nodemon` on `index.js`. So, it's `'Listening on' port '4000'`.

```shell
nodemon index.js
```

Let's bring up **Swagger** open a **web browser** and type in **the address** http://localhost:4000/restaurants. So, here, this is **if we hit** `restaurants`, the **route restaurants**, this is **the route** that we've got, will **get returned** a **list of restaurants**. So, there's that.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_01.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_01.png)

But **if we hit** http://localhost:4000/api-docs/#/, then we **get this user interface**.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_02.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_02.png)

And the **nice thing** about it is **if we go to** `GET`, you'll see that **we can try it out**.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_03.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_03.png)

So, herewith `GET`, we **don't need** to put in any **parameters**. We can **just execute**. And here **you'll see** that it does a `curl` on `http://localhost:4000/restaurants`. And it **returns to us** the **list of restaurants** which we **hardcoded** in `index.js`.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_04.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_04.png)

So, **let's go back** to `index.js` and **let's put in** some **other routes**. So, **let's put** in a `post`, and a `delete`. I'm **going to leave** the `delete` **for the moment** because I want you **to do** the **documentation** for it in `swagger.json`, but here's the `post`.

* So, we're going to `post`, and we're just going to **send back the name** of the **restaurant**.


* And what **we should do** is we **should add that** to `restaurants`. So, let's do `restaurants.push()`, and we want to **push into it**. Well, we want `{id:}`, and now, **we need to get out** of the `post`, add a `req.body.id,`. And **we need to get** the `name:`, which is **going to be** `req.body.name}`. So, we'll `push` that into the `restaurants`.


* And we're going to **push back** that **this restaurant** was **created**. We could **push back** the **list of restaurants**. Maybe we should do that. Let's do that. *Let's push back* **all the restaurants**. So, here **we will send back** `restaurants`, and we'll just say `'created'`.

Okay, **so that's** the **documentation** here.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

var restaurants = [{id:0,name:"Woodshill"}, {id:1,name:"Fiorellas"}]

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument))

app.get("/restaurants", (req,res)=>{
    res.send(restaurants);
})

app.post("/restaurant",(req,res)=>{
    restaurants.push({id: req.body.id, name: req.body.name})
    res.send(`${JSON.stringify(restaurants)} created`)
})

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

**Let's go** and **look at swagger**. Now, for `swagger.json`, we **need to continue down here** and put in a **new restaurant** under there it will be a `"post"`. So, here, we're **going to carry on**. Let's go and see **what that looks like**. So, here we're **going to put in**, let's go see what this is.

* So, **now our route** is `"/restaurant":`, and **it's going to be** a `"post":`. 
* And we're **going to take** `"parameters":`.
  * We need a `"name":`.
  * And then **we're going to get** the `"schema":` from the **same scheme** that **we used before**.
* So, **these are** the **parameters coming in**. We **need at least** the ` "name":` of a `"restaurant"`. So, we're **not going to require** the `id`.
* And then **this will produce** `"application.json"`.
* And this is the `response` **if we succeed**. 

And **let's save** that and **go back** to **our project** now.

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "/restaurants": {
      "get": {
        "tags": ["Restaurants"],
        "summary": "Get all Restaurants in system",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "OK",
            "schema": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Restaurant"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    },
    
    "/restaurant": {
      "post": {
        "tags": ["Restaurants"],
        "description": "Create new restaurant in system",
        "parameters": [
          {
            "name": "restaurant",
            "in": "body",
            "description": "Restaurant that we want to create",
            "schema": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Restaurant"
            }
          }
        ],
        "produces": [
          "application/json"
        ],
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "New restaurant is created",
            "schema": {
              "$ref": "#/definitions/Restaurant"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  },
  
  "definitions": {
    "Restaurant": {
      "required": ["id","name"],
      "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
          "uniqueItems": true
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

And **we'll see** that we've got a `POST`.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_05.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_05.png)

**Let's go** and see **if we can create** a **new restaurant**. So, under here, we **need to try it out**, and we **need to put** a **new restaurant** in.

* Let's put restaurant `2`, for the `"id":`
* And for **the string** Let's put `"Olive Garden"`. And **let's execute** that. 

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_06.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_06.png)

And **what we see** is that **we get back** the **restaurant** we provided. We've got an **id** of `2` and for **the name** we've got `Olive Garden`.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_07.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_07.png)

So, that's `GET` and `POST`. What I want you to do is to add, `delete` to that. So, I want to show, I'll show you what it looks like. **I'll start** the **documentation** for you in `swagger.json`, but you're going to **need to finish it up**. So, here we need so** all of these are under** `"paths":{}`. So, we're going to **add a new path**.

* And **this path** is going to be a **delete**. Let's **take a look** at it. And **it starts off** like this, `"/restaurant/{id}":`. So, we **need to pass in** an `id`. So, I need to **hit the route**, say `restaurant/`, and if I put `2` in, it'll **delete the restaurant** with `id 2`. And **I'm specifying here** these **parameters**, `id` of the restaurant and `"delete":`. You need to **complete this**.

```json
{
  "paths": {
    
  "/restaurant/{id}": {
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "id",
        "in": "path",
        "required": true,
        "description": "ID of restaurant that we want to delete",
        "type": "integer"
      }
    ],
      "delete": {
      "tags": ["Restaurants"],
        "summary": "Delete Restaurant",
        "responses": {
          "200": {
            "description": "OK",
                  "schema": {
                    "$ref": "#/definitions/Restaurant"
                    }
        }
      }
    }
  }
},
  "definitions": {
    "Restaurant": {
      "required": ["id","name"],
              "properties": {
        "id": {
          "type": "integer",
                  "uniqueItems": true
        },
        "name": {
          "type": "string"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

So, **once it's completed**, we should have **seen something** like this. Where we've got to `DELETE` here.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_08.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_08.png)

And **we can go in** and **delete a restaurant**. I'll **put the code** in for `delete` in `index.js`.

* So, you can **see it in here**. Here's the **route for delete** which is `"/restaurant/:id", and **we're passing in** an `id`.
* And so, **I'll take a look** for the `**` in the list of restaurants** and then **remove it** by **filtering it out**.
* And so, and then **I'll return** whatever **restaurants are left**.

```js
const express = require('express')
const swaggerUi = require('swagger-ui-express')
const swaggerDocument = require('./swagger.json');

var restaurants = [{id:0,name:"Woodshill"}, {id:1,name:"Fiorellas"}]

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.use('/api-docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument))

app.get("/restaurants", (req,res)=>{
  res.send(restaurants);
})
app.post("/restaurant",(req,res)=>{
  restaurants.push({id:req.body.id, name:req.body.name})
  res.send(`${JSON.stringify(restaurants)} created`)
})
app.delete("/restaurant/:id", (req,res)=>{
  console.log('delete:id:'+req.params.id)
  restaurants = restaurants.filter(item=> item.id != req.params.id)
  res.send("restaurants left:"+JSON.stringify(restaurants));
})

app.listen(4000,()=>console.log('Listening on 4000'))
```

if we **go back** to **the browser** and test the `delete` function. So we enter the **id** of `1` which is **the restaurant** `Karma` that **will be deleted**.

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_09.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_09.png)

As you can see **the restaurant** `Karma` with the **id** of `1` was **deleted** in the **array list**. 

![Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example_10.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.7_Swagger_API_Restaurant_Example%2FSwagger_API_Restaurant_Example_10.png)

Okay, so that's `Swagger`. And it **produces** a **very nice interface** that **we can test** and **define our APIs**.

Don't forget to **close the server** by entering `CTRL + C`. This will also free up `port 3000`.

```shell
CTRL + C
```
