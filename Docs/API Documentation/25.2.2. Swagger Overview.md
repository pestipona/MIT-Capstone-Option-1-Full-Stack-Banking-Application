# 25.2.2. Swagger Overview:

[Swagger](https://swagger.io/) is an **open-source tool** that helps you **design**, **build**, and **document REST APIs**, making your code **more shareable**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_002.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_002.jpg)

**Creating software** is a **complex process**. So, the **quicker** we can **instrument** our **application programming interfaces**, the **quicker** we can **integrate feedback**, the better off we will do.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_003.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_003.jpg)

Now if we think about the **entire development cycle**, if we think about **the loop** that we go through, there are a **number of questions** that we need to **answer**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_004.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_004.jpg)

**Initially**, *why are we writing this? Who's using it? At what scope are we using it?*

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_005.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_005.jpg)

And then as we **start to write** our **code** and **build and test**, we want to **integrate that feedback**. But as **mentioned previously**, how can we do that **quicker**? How can we **integrate** and **share feedback** that ultimately we always **need to incorporate**?

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_006.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_006.jpg)

So, **one of the questions** is, **how can we do it quicker?** Now **documentation usable code** is **one way**, but how can we do this **without being distracted** in **trying to**, in **creating** that **documentation**, and **exposing** that **shareable code**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_007.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_007.jpg)

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_008.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_008.jpg)

So, there's a **number of tools** that **we can use**. In this case, we're going to use [Swagger](https://swagger.io/), a **documentation tool** that has **wide adoption** in the **software industry**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_009.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_009.jpg)

More formally, as you can see here, it's a **set of standards** around an **open API specification** that we can use at **several levels**. We can use it **to design, to build, to document**. And ultimately, it's **doing a lot of work** around **REST APIs**.

![Module 25 - Summary Deck_Page_010.jpg](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.2._Swagger_Overview%2FModule%2025%20-%20Summary%20Deck_Page_010.jpg)

Now, in our case, we're **going to go ahead** and **use Swagger** as mentioned, and we'll **add to that** a few **other packages** that **integrate very well** with the **node stack**.

* As you can see here, we're going to be **integrating Swagger** with **automatic documentation generation** that we will **derive** from the **comments** *we will write* **in our code**.


* We will also use **Swagger** with our **Express framework**.


* And *ultimately*, we will also add their `nodemon` to give us **automatic reloading**.

This is the **overview** of what we're going to be **carrying out**. Next, we will **start building**.
