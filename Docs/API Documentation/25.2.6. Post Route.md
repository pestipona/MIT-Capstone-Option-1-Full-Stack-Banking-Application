# 25.2.6. Post Route:

Now **youâ€™ll use** the **same library example** and **generate an API** along with **documentation** for a `POST` route. 

Follow the steps in [25.2.3. Install Packages](/Docs/25.2.3.%20Install%20Packages.md) to **recreate the environment**, and **install** all **packages** and **dependencies** for **the project**.

To **start the application** run `npm start`

```shell
npm start
```

In our **previous lesson**, we added **automatic documentation** for a `get` route. **In this case**, let's go ahead and **add one** for `posts`. We're **going to start off** by adding some `express` **configuration** and **package** so that **we can parse** `post` **data**. As you can see there, **we're using** the **package** `bodyParser`. Let's go ahead and **save that**.

```js
// data parser - used to parse post data
var bodyParser= require('body-parser');
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({extended: false}));
app.use(bodyParser.json());
```

Once **we've done that**, we **can go ahead** and write our **postcode**. I'm going to go ahead and **enter it here**. And as you can see there, the `post` is **going to be** to a **path of book**, *singular as well as plural before*, and we're **simply going** to be **looking for one parameter**. And we're going to go ahead and **echo that back** to the **hauling client**.

```js
app.post('/book', (req, res) => {
    const title = req.body.title;
    res.send({title});
});
```

Now, on a **broader**, **bigger application**, we would **store this** to **the database**, but here we're simply looking at the **mechanisms for documentation** and **how do we express** that here in **our comments**.

So, **I'm going to go ahead** and **paste that**, that, **those comments** now and as **you can see here**, we are **denoting** that **now we're doing** a `post:`.

* We have a `description:` and **this part is new**.
* We are **going to specify** a `parameter`, in this case, **a single one**, and **the name** of that `parameter` is going to be `title`.
* We're going to have here **some descriptions** about **what that parameter** is and **where that data** is going to be, in this case, **in the body**, whether it's **required** and **what type it is**.

All of this, as **mentioned before**, you **can get more detail** on in the **documentation**. But for now, **let's go ahead** and **save** and **test this new method** and this **new documentation**.

```yaml
/**
 * @swagger
 * /book:
 *  post:
 *      description: Get one book
 *      parameters:
 *      - name: title
 *        description: Book title
 *        in: body
 *        required: true
 *        type: string
 *      responses:
 *          200:
 *              description: Success
 *
 */
```

So, **let's go ahead** and **open up** a **new browser** and **type in** `http://localhost:3000/api-docs`. And as **you can see there**, **we now have** a **new route**.

And **if I go ahead** and **expand it**, we can go ahead and **try it out**. I'm going to go head and **enter here** a `JSON message`, the **string** `JSON message`, and I'm simply going to go ahead and **enter here some JSON**, the **name of the variable** is` ' {"title":'`. Then I'm going to go ahead and **give it a name**. And I'm simply going to enter here ` "Using swagger"}`.

```json
{
    "isbn": "9788845292613",
    "title": "The Lord Of The Rings",
    "author": "J.R.R. Tolkien",
    "publisher": "Allen & Unwin"
}
```

![Post_Route_02.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.6_Post_Route%2FPost_Route_02.png)

Now **I can go ahead** and **execute that payload**. I'm going to go ahead and **click on that button**. And as you can see there **we get** that **echoed response**. You can see here that **we got back** `"title": "Using swagger"`. You can see there that we've gotten also automatically **how to invoke this** using `Curl`, **how to access** that **specific route** in **the browser**, and **we get there** a good fair amount of **functionality**, all of it **automatically generated** for us.

![Post_Route_03.png](..%2FScreen_Shots%2F25.2.6_Post_Route%2FPost_Route_03.png)

So, once again, as you can see there with **some minimal extra effort** in **simply documenting the API** or **the route** that **you're using**, you can get **some automatically generated documentation**. As mentioned previously, this is a **good practice to have**. And if you want to **learn more about it**, go ahead and **navigate over to the packages** that we use in `npm` or in the **Swagger documentation**.
